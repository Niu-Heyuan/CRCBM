# WES-Analysis
In this study, we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis on a cohort of 26 patients with CRC and a cohort of 55 patients with CRCBM, with nonsynchronous matched primary samples available for 13 individuals. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of various mutations, including genomic alterations, distributions and frequency patterns, as well as mutations in tumor-associated genes and somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in CRC, primary tumors, and brain metastases in CRCBM. We also investigated driver genes and copy number variations (CNVs) across the three cohorts. Additionally, we utilized seven large sample cohorts to validate the prevalence of specific genes. For the 13 individuals from whom both primary and metastatic samples were collected, we identified putative driver genetic events that may have arisen from clonal evolution that could facilitate metastasis, and we examined the clonal evolution process. Furthermore, we compared HLA typing, neoantigens, and pathways that are affected by genetic alterations in patients with brain metastases to better understand the mechanisms that may determine the specific site of metastasis.
